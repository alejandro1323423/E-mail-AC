<h1>SUBJECT: Data Quality: Duplicated data</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Dear Eulalio Tulermo, I hope this message finds you well Im reporting this to your attention, a issue that generates innacurate data results, impacting our data analysis processes.<b></b> A few minutes ago, i realized that needs a solution as soon
    as possible.<b></b> There is a data duplication issue that makes our data-analysis results innacurate.<b></b> Problem Description: at a hour ago, i was processing the data to end the day, so, i saw an anomaly in the<b></b> database, specifically,
    a data duplication issue.<b></b> Impact: the issue with the data quality has several negative results: 1.<b></b> Innacurate analysis: duplicated data alters the results for the data analysis, doing things like: gives a bigger incorrect values to a
    chart. 2.<b></b> <b></b>Bugs in the app: deleting the duplicated values in the csv database gives bugs like NaN values in the data visualization from the app Proposed solution: To fix this issue, i recommend these solutions: 1.<b></b> Improve clean
    function: improve the function to delete rows and fix the NaN values. 2. Data validation: make a function that valides there isn't previous values coindiding with the new one register.<b></b> I would appreciate your approval to proceed with the proposed
    solution steps. If the problem persists, let me know. thank you for your attention.
    <b></b> Best regards, Sr.amongus Founder
